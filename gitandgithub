Git: is a version control system
	git init => to initialize the folder
to keep track:
Staging Environment: git add . => add files
git status => status of the files
git commit => is a record of the state of the folder
git log => shows us where we are at, shows a logs of all commit
commit vs staging is like saving and printing
git checkout filename=> can discard the changes in the working directory

unstaging => git reset HEAD filename => replacing staging environment into working environment

DELETING FILES:
	also have to delete from staging
	git rm filename or .
	rm => deletes also from the staging environment
	git add --all => super push to delete the file

Manging your log:
	has a long hash
	use the hash to pull the project
	git checkout hash_number
	
git checkout master => use to go back to normal branch
to use the other branch => git checkout branchname

Git Branches: 
	create new => git branch branchname

Git Merge: from one branch to another
	if you are on master : git merge other_branch_name
	
rename a branch => git branch -m  original_name new_name
remove a branch => git branch -D branch_name

Download project with all branches => git branch -a to see all branches
	pull other branches => git checkout -b branch_name location (origin/branch_name)
	pull at once => create a directory
			switch to the directory
			clone a repo => git clone --mirror git_url .git

git clone -b branch_name git_url => clone specific branch from git project
